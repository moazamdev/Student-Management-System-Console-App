# Student-Management-System-Console-App

## Introduction

- This project aims to develop a program for managing student records.
- Procedural programming methodology is used in this program.
- Array data structure is used in the program.
- It is a console-based application.
- This project is developed with C++ programming language. 

## Scope

- It provides "better and efficient" service. 
- Reduce the workload of an institute. 
- A faster way to get information about the students.
- It facilitates keeping all the students' records, such as their name, roll no, etc.

## Working

- These are some basic functions used in our project:
1. Enter data (It is used to enter some basic data of students)
2. Show data (It is used to show the data of total no. of students)
3. Search data (It is used to search for the specific student data by using its roll no.)
4. Update data (It is used to update data for the specific student by using its roll no.)
5. Delete data (It is used to delete data either by a specific roll no or delete all student data in the program)
6. Exit program (It is used to end the program)

## Conclusion

- The purpose of the student management system is to enable educational institutions to maintain their student records easily. 
- Achieving this objective with the manual system may be very time-consuming, but this project solves all these problems.
- The system helps keep track of all the details of the students, such as their name, address, and grade.
